<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>
  This ReadMe does not aim to be a complete introduction to xCash Klassic or to cryptocurrencies in general.
  If you are new to crypto, it is worth spending some time with general introductions to
  private, proof-of-work coins and basic wallet concepts before you move significant value.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that xCash Klassic and its software are constantly evolving; it probably won't take
  long for some of the information here to become outdated. Always consult the official
  project channels for the latest details.
</p>

<h2>Content of the Package</h2>

<p>
  You just installed the <i>xCash GUI wallet</i> for Windows, version {#GuiVersion}.
  The wallet enables you to send and receive xCash Klassic in a secure and privacy-preserving way.
</p>

<p>
  This installer is focused on the <i>GUI wallet</i> and related command-line tools.
  It is configured to use <b>remote nodes</b> by default, so you can start using xCash Klassic
  without running your own full node on this machine.
</p>

<p>
  For checking whether there are newer versions of this package, please visit the official
  X-Cash project site or release pages linked from the community channels.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading</h2>

<p>
  If you already have a release of the xCash Klassic GUI wallet on your computer that was installed
  with the help of this installer (in an earlier version), upgrading is easy:
  just run the new installer; there is no need to uninstall the old release first.
</p>

<p>
  If you previously downloaded a zip file and unpacked a “portable” GUI wallet into a folder,
  do not try to upgrade by pointing this installer at that same folder — it can make
  uninstalling later messy.
</p>

<p>
  Instead, let this installer place the software into its own folder and then remove the old
  folder manually (after moving away any extra files you may have stored there).
  Wallet files and other user data are normally stored in separate locations and are not
  deleted by simply removing the old program folder.
</p>

<h2>Access to the Blockchain</h2>

<p>
  Any xCash Klassic wallet needs access to the <i>blockchain</i>, the ongoing ledger of all xCash Klassic
  transactions. For the GUI wallet there is one principal ways to get that access:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use a <b>remote node</b> (default): the wallet connects over the network to a node
    operated by you on another machine or by a third party.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For many users, especially on laptops or limited hardware, using a trusted remote node
  is a practical compromise that allows you to use xCash Klassic without storing the full chain locally.
</p>

<h2>Initial Synchronization</h2>

<p>
  Even when using a remote node, your wallet must still <i>scan</i> the blockchain to discover
  transactions belonging to your addresses. This process is called synchronization or “sync”.
</p>

<p>
  The time required depends on several factors, including network speed, node responsiveness,
  and how long it has been since the wallet was last opened. The first sync for a brand-new
  wallet may take longer than subsequent sessions.
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
  The xCash Klassic software and especially the GUI wallet are still evolving. Occasionally,
  things can go wrong or behave in unexpected ways.
</p>

<p>
  Despite technical problems you may encounter, your xCash Klassic coins are almost always safe:
  you may temporarily be unable to move them or see the correct balance, but you usually
  won’t lose funds as long as you keep your recovery information secure.
</p>

<p>
  The most critical piece of information is your wallet’s seed (or equivalent backup).
  <b>Never lose your seed, and never share it with anyone.</b>
</p>

<p>
  In the <i>Utilities</i> sub-folder of the xCash Klassic program group there are several icons that
  may help you solve problems. These are the icons with an <i>x</i> in front and a descriptive
  name in parentheses to make them visually stand out from the “everyday” entries.
</p>

<p>Here is an overview of the utilities installed with this GUI package:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><i>x (Try GUI Wallet Low Graphics Mode)</i></td>
    <td>
      Run the GUI wallet in a mode that is more tolerant of
      low-end or virtualized graphics hardware. Use this if the normal wallet window
      fails to appear, renders incorrectly, or feels very slow.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><i>x (Check GUI Wallet Log)</i></td>
    <td>
      Open the log file containing status and error messages from the GUI wallet in Notepad.
      This can be useful for diagnostics; the last few lines often contain the most relevant
      information if something has gone wrong.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><i>x (Check Default Wallet Folder)</i></td>
    <td>
      Open the standard wallet storage folder in Windows Explorer. This is useful if you want
      to back up your wallet files or inspect them directly.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  If you encounter issues you cannot resolve, consider collecting the GUI log and any error
  messages and sharing them (redacting sensitive information) with the xCash-Labs community or
  support channels for further assistance.
